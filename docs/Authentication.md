# Authentication

We're trying to do something a little new with authentication at Veue.

We're going to use non-traditional methods to ensure that our people are..

1. REAL
2. Who they say they are

We need to strongly work to keep spam at 0% in order to ensure that our platform and community feels safe.

When possible, we will setup Honeytraps!

## OTP

We mostly use One Time Passwords, instead of using "real" passwords that are permanent.

In the initial version, the OTP will be a 4 digit numeric code.

In order to trap bots, we use a code that's between **1982 and 9820.** This way, any attempt to use
a code outside of that range means we have ourselves something very suspicious!
