  @hcatlin - 2020-09-28

  - ###ADDED
    - Time Display helper functions like `displayTime(seconds)` to output to something like `01:32:45`
    - Tests that ACTUALLY _play_ a video, and embedded a simple video playlist into the `public/_tests` folder
      for both live and not live streams
    - The main element of this ticket... displaying the time counter when the audience is watching a VOD stream
  - ###CHANGED
    - We no longer use the mux_playback_id to figure out what video stream to select, and instead we have a
      column in the `videos` table called `hls_url` that has the HLS link.
    - Created a better state handler for the `audience_view_controller.ts` to make the "video playing"
      `system/vod_audience_spec.rb` tests more reliable.
